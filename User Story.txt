Story: As a System designer, I want an independent system which can output a stacking pattern for a given set of polyhedrons on a given polygon surface. So that i can create multiple interfaces and Implementations on top of it and use it for any shape and restriction. 
Acceptance Criteria: I want the output stacking pattern to have following properties 
1. Lower Centre of Mass
2. Centre of gravity near to the centre the centre 
3. Highest Volume utilization
User should be able to control all the variables through input and the output pattern should be given within 3 Seconds.

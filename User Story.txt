Story : 
As a maniac, I want an indipendent system which can output a stacking patten for a given set of ployhedrons on a given ploygon serface. So that i can create multiple interfaces and implementations on top of it and use it for any shape and ristriction. 

Acceptance Criteria: 
I want the output stacking pattern to have following properties 
1. Lower Center of Mass
2. Center of gravity near to the center the center 
3. Highest Volume utilization
User should be able to control all the variables through input and the output patten should be given within 3 Seconds.
